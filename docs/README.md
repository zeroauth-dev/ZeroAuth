# ZeroAuth Documentation

ZeroAuth is a hosted authentication API that combines zero-knowledge biometric verification, enterprise federation (SAML, OIDC), and blockchain-anchored decentralized identity into a single platform.

No packages to install. Create an account at [zeroauth.dev](https://zeroauth.dev), get an API key, and start making requests.

## What ZeroAuth Does

ZeroAuth exposes three authentication paths through a unified REST API:

- **ZKP biometric auth** — Privacy-preserving proof-based verification. Zero biometric data stored. Ever.
- **SAML 2.0** — Enterprise SSO integration with identity providers.
- **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC** — Modern authorization code flow with PKCE.

The platform also provides:

- JWT-based access and refresh tokens,
- scoped API keys with per-tenant rate limiting and usage metering,
- optional Base Sepolia blockchain anchoring for decentralized identity,
- a developer console for API key management and usage monitoring.

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** at `https://zeroauth.dev/api/console/signup` and get your API key.
2. **Authenticate requests** with `Authorization: Bearer za_live_YOUR_KEY`.
3. **Call v1 endpoints** — register identities, verify ZK proofs, initiate SSO flows.
4. **Monitor usage** via the developer console API.

Every API call is metered, rate-limited, and scoped to your tenant account. See [Plans](getting-started/quickstart.md#plans) for limits.
