# Environment Variables

This page documents the environment variables used by the ZeroAuth platform. These are internal configuration variables — as an API consumer, you only need an API key to get started.

:::info
If you are integrating with ZeroAuth's hosted API, you do not need to configure any of these variables. Just use your API key with `https://zeroauth.dev`. This page is provided for transparency and for contributors to the ZeroAuth platform.
